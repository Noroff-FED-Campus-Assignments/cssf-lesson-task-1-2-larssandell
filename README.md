## SASS Lesson Task

### Brief

Start with the page created in the [Bootstrap introduction](/css-frameworks/module-1/intro-to-bootstrap). Design a theme adjustment that adds custom details to the basic Bootstrap theme. For example, a dark mode theme or a contrasting colour scheme.

Next, copy your page HTML and remove all references to CSS. You should have an HTML file with the necessary information and elements, but no styling whatsoever.

Your task is to rebuild the styles for your page, only using your own custom SASS.

You do not need to copy Bootstrap's implementation exactly - but do not change any classnames in HTML. 

### Process

1. Copy an existing Bootstrap HTML file.
2. Design a theme adjustment that provides contrast with the original.
3. Remove all references to Bootstrap CSS.
4. Rebuild the styles for the new design using SASS.

### Delivery

1. Deliver link to github repo on teams assignment.
